## Replicating the Club Mate fountain challenge

To replicate the Club Mate fountain challenge you will need to:

1. Install [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) & [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard).
1. Load a map if wanted, or create one.
1. In game with OP permissions run the following commands on a world edit selected area to create the challenge in:

    * `/rg define <name>`
    * `/rg flag <name> entry deny`
1. When trying a bypass it is important **Not** to be OP, because it will let you bypass the region's protection.
1. Have some fun with it, and may the programming be with you.
